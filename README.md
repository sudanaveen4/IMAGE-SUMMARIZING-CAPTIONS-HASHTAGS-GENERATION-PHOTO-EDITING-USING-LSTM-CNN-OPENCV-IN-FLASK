# IMAGE-SUMMARIZING-CAPTIONS-HASHTAGS-GENERATION-PHOTO-EDITING-USING-LSTM-CNN-OPENCV-IN-FLASK

flask application which generates hashtags and captions using lstm and cnn as well as edit images, The picture features will be taken by the CNN (vgg-16) model, which was trained on the imagenet dataset, and fed into the LSTM model, which will provide the image captions.

## Hardware requirements:

- Computer or Server: A computer or server with sufficient processing power and memory to handle image processing tasks efficiently.
- Storage: Adequate storage capacity to store the dataset, model files, and processed images.
- Internet Connectivity: A stable internet connection for accessing external resources, such as the caption dataset and trending hashtag information.

## Software requirements:

- Operating System: Any modern operating system compatible with the selected software stack (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

- Python: The programming language used for implementing the solution.

- Flask: A web framework for building the user interface and handling server-side logic.

- OpenCV: A computer vision library for image processing tasks, such as resizing, enhancing, and applying filters to images.

- YOLO (You Only Look Once): An object detection framework for detecting objects in images.

- Bootstrap: A popular front-end framework for creating responsive and user-friendly web interfaces.

- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages used for designing and formatting web pages.

- JavaScript: A programming language for adding interactivity and dynamic elements to the web application.

- Edge:we are using edge as an web browser.

By utilizing these hardware and software components, the project can be implemented effectively, providing a user-friendly website with image summarization, captioning, and photo editing capabilities.
